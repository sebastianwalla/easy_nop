# easy_nop
IDAPython Plugin which allows the NOPing of marked Byte-Sequences

The original source of this program was published on this forum: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/343177-easy-nop-ida-plugin.html

I just updated the Plugin to be compatible with Python3 and IDA 7.6

Installation is as easy as coping easy_nop.y into your IDA installations `plugin` directory.
